This board replaces the first game board, which was not fully working or fully M8 compatible.

It has a TMS9918A video processor with composite video output, stereo sound output from a Philips SAA1099 IC, and one Atari style joystick port. The sound IC and joystick are interfaced via an MC6821 PIA.
